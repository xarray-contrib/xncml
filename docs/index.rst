`xncml` adds NcML support to xarray. It includes utilities to modify NcML documents,
and open NcML files as `xarray.Dataset`.
For more information on NcML, take a look at
[tutorials and examples](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/basic_ncml_tutorial.html)
and the [annotated schema](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/current/userguide/annotated_ncml_schema.html).


Note the existence of a similar [project](https://github.com/ioos/ncml)
to edit NcML documents, now archived.
